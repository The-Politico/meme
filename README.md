# Meme (Data Desk remix)

Meme is a generator that Vox Media uses to create social sharing images. See working version at [http://www.sbnation.com/a/meme](http://www.sbnation.com/a/meme).

This is the Los Angeles Times Data Desk's fork. Here is what we changed:

- Substituted in Los Angeles Times watermarks
- Created a new set of options to change the image's aspect ratio
